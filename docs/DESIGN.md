# Weltspiegel Template - Design Reference

A quick reference for design decisions, colors, breakpoints, and patterns used in the template.

## Target devices (measured, not assumed)

Design priority derived from the site's own visitor measurement (`com_statistics`, first
30 days from 2026-08-20, ~23,000 page views; the figures barely moved between week one and
month one):

| Fact | Share |
| ---- | ----- |
| Touch as primary input | ~87% |
| Viewport below 480px | 79% |
| Viewport 360–413px | 68% |
| Classic "tablet" zone 480–1023px | 4% |
| Viewport 768px and up | 19%, of which the largest single group is ≥1600px |

Two working principles follow from this:

1. **Touch and small screens come first.** Every layout decision is judged at 360px and
   400px, which together cover two thirds of all visits. Hover must never be the only path
   to a function, and tap targets are sized for fingers, not cursors.
2. **Desktop is not a leftover.** One visit in five is a wide screen, most of them very
   wide — this is where the design may be generous and show off, as long as doing so never
   costs anything on small screens (progressive enhancement, not graceful degradation).

The thin tablet zone is why the single breakpoint at 768px works so well: the layout
switches almost exactly where nobody is. See also "Key Breakpoint: 768px" below.

### "Wide" does not mean "mouse"

The width × input cross tabulation corrects an assumption that is easy to make: the
desktop layout is *not* a mouse-only audience.

| Viewport | Touch share |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 768–1023px | 87% |
| 1024–1279px | 75% |
| 1280–1599px | 31% |
| 1600px and up | 1% |

The 768–1279px range is roughly 80% touch — these are tablets, not small laptops. Taken
together, **about a third of all views that receive the desktop layout come from touch
devices**; genuine pointer use only takes over above 1280px and dominates from 1600px.

Consequence: principle 1's "hover is never the only path" applies to the **desktop layout
too**, not just below 768px. A wide-screen flourish may reveal extra detail on hover, but
it must never be the only way to reach a function or an essential piece of information.

## Colors

All colors are defined as CSS custom properties in `_variables.css`.

| Variable               | Value              | Usage                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--color-bg-body`      | `#100501`          | Dark brown/black page background            |
| `--color-fg-body`      | `#ffffff`          | White text color                            |
| `--color-accent`       | `#f29400`          | Orange accent (headings, links, highlights) |
| `--color-accent-hover` | 80% accent + black | Darker orange for hover states              |

**The dark palette is deliberate and fixed.** The relaunch was built to carry the previous
site's look over to the new one without a visual break, so `prefers-color-scheme` is
knowingly *not* honoured — the site is dark for everyone. The measurement puts the visitors'
system preference at roughly one third dark, two thirds light, which is worth knowing but
does not change the decision. A light variant is far down the road and may never be built;
the trigger for revisiting it would be actual complaints from the client's visitors, not
this number.


### Showbox Colors (Booking Grid)

| Variable                | Value                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `--showbox-header-bg`   | `rgba(170, 119, 84, 0.4)`  |
| `--showbox-cell-bg`     | `rgba(112, 84, 69, 0.3)`   |
| `--showbox-cell-bg-alt` | `rgba(135, 108, 94, 0.25)` |
| `--showbox-border`      | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)`       |

### Format Badge Colors (2D/3D, language, duration, FSK)

Badges use a mix of the accent color and the official FSK age-rating colors (see
`_fsk-badge.css`). They are not CSS variables — colors are hardcoded per modifier class:

| Badge                                  | Style                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `.format-badge--3d`                    | Filled accent background, dark text (matches `.showbox-dimension-label--3d`) |
| `.format-badge--2d`                    | Dark filled background, accent text/border (matches `.showbox-dimension-label--2d`) |
| `.format-badge--lang` (language)       | Accent outline, accent text                         |
| `.format-badge--duration`              | Dark filled chip (`--color-bg-body`), white text/icon, no border — deliberately set apart from the other badges |
| `.fsk-badge--0/6/12/16/18`             | Official FSK colors (white/yellow/green/blue/red)   |
| `.fsk-badge--pending` ("FSK folgt")     | Grey                                                |

### Design Notes

- Dark cinema aesthetic with warm brown/orange tones
- Main content area has radial gradient overlay: `rgba(46, 30, 10, 0.9)` to `rgba(25, 16, 6, 0.9)`
- Paper texture background (`paper-pattern.jpg`) visible as frame around content
- Card/panel borders use semi-transparent orange: `#f2940080`

## Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width   | Layout Description                                   |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Mobile     | < 768px | Single column, stacked layout                        |
| Tablet     | 768px+  | Centered content, side-by-side cards, flipped titles |
| Desktop    | 1024px+ | Left-aligned with ticket image on left               |
| Wide       | 1280px+ | Centered with ticket, max-width container            |

### Key Breakpoint: 768px

This is the primary mobile/desktop breakpoint used throughout:

- Card/detail layouts switch from stacked to side-by-side (poster | content)
- Flipped titles become visible and rotate 90°
- Truncate height sync activates (JS constant: `DESKTOP_BREAKPOINT = 768`)
- Navigation switches to mobile hamburger menu

## Typography

### Fonts

- **Body**: `system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif` (system font stack)
- **Headings**: `'Kameron', serif` (self-hosted woff2, weights: 400, 700)

### Font Sizes

- Body: `1rem` (16px default)
- Line height: `1.6` (body text)
- Headings: `font-weight: 500` (medium)
- Flipped titles: `clamp(2rem, 5vw, 2.5rem)`

### Self-Hosted Fonts

Located in `media/fonts/`:

- `kameron-v18-latin-regular.woff2`
- `kameron-v18-latin-700.woff2`

## Layout Patterns

### Page Container

```
Mobile:     [  content  ]
Tablet:     [  content  ] (centered, max-width)
Desktop:    [ticket][content    ] (left-aligned)
Wide:       [ticket][content    ] (centered)
```

The ticket image (`eintrittskarte.png`) appears at 1024px+ as a decorative element.

### Content Width

- `--content-width: 768px` - Optimal reading width for flow text
- Full container calculation includes: content + padding + flipped title space

**Fixed in `px`, not `rem` (deliberately):** `--content-width` and the ticket-reservation
terms in `.page-container`'s desktop `max-width`/`padding-left` (`192px` ticket space +
`16px` spacing, see `template.css`), plus the ticket image's own `left: 16px` offset, are
all pinned in `px`. Everything else in the layout (article padding, flipped-title space,
right-hand padding) intentionally still scales with the user's root font-size.

Reason: a user's root font-size preference (e.g. Firefox's "Nur Text zoomen" / "Zoom Text
Only") shrinks or grows every `rem` value simultaneously. The reading-width variable must
not shrink below its intended size just because of that setting. More importantly, the
ticket image itself is a *fixed-size* `192×217px` background asset — if the space reserved
for it (`padding-left`, the `max-width` ticket terms, and the image's own `left` offset)
were still `rem`-based, a smaller root font-size would shrink the reserved zone while the
image stayed the same size, and the ticket would visually overlap into the content area
(observed live at a client site with 12px root font-size instead of the usual 16px). A
*larger* root font-size has the mirror-image failure mode: the image's `left` offset would
grow past the (then-larger) reserved zone. Pinning both the reservation and the offset in
`px` keeps them mathematically consistent regardless of root font-size.

## Key Design Patterns

### Shared Listing Component (`.listing` / `.listing-card`)

Used by all list views: `movies`, `vorschauen` (category 8), `veranstaltungen` (category 9).
One shared component instead of per-view CSS — layout changes apply everywhere at once.

```
Mobile:     poster
            content (title + truncated description)
            meta (badges — optional)
            details (optional, e.g. genre)
            showtimes (optional)

Desktop:    poster | content
            meta / details / showtimes (full width, below)
```

- Grid-based, fixed poster width (`10.75rem` on desktop)
- Slots (`__meta`, `__details`, `__showtimes`, tagline via `utilities.truncate`) are only
  rendered when data exists — no empty gaps
- `.listing-card--no-poster` drops the poster column entirely (e.g. articles without an image)
- Rendered by: `com_weltspiegel/movies/default.php`, `com_content/category/blog.php`

### Shared Detail Component (`.detail` / `.detail__inner`)

Used by all single-item views: `movie`, `vorschau`, `veranstaltung` (not by generic articles —
those keep the plain `.article` layout).

```
Desktop:    [back-link]
            [FSK badge, top-right of .detail__inner]
            title
            poster (float left) | meta badges, details/tagline
            body (wraps around poster, flow-root contains the float)
            showtimes / trailer / gallery (clear: both, full width)
```

- `.detail__inner` uses `display: flow-root` so the border box always wraps the floated
  poster, even when the surrounding text is shorter than the poster image
- Poster width is a variable, `--detail-poster-width` (default `10.75rem` for movies).
  The article variants (`.detail--full`, `.detail--simple`) override it to `300px` — a
  deliberately larger, wrap-around banner image, not unified with the movie poster width
- Rendered by: `com_weltspiegel/movie/default.php`, `com_content/article/default.php`
  (the `isComponentManaged` / `useContentSingleLayout` branches only)

### Format Badges (`.format-badges`, `booking/formats.php`, `movie/fsk.php`, `movie/duration.php`)

A shared badge row used in both `.listing-card__meta` and `.detail__meta`:

- **FSK** (`movie/fsk.php`): parses `ALTERSFREIGABE`, renders a colored badge linked to
  `/service/fsk-und-jugendschutz#fsk-N`. Special cases: "FSK folgt" → grey "FSK ?" badge;
  "keine Angabe" → omitted entirely.
- **Format flags + languages** (`booking/formats.php`): aggregates **all** EVENT variants of
  a movie into two separate badge groups — dimension (2D/3D from `is3D`) and language
  (from `LANGUAGE`, e.g. "Englisch (OmU)"). This is additive to, and independent from, the
  `$getCategory` logic in `booking/showtimes.php` and `mod_current_events` (which serve a
  different purpose: a single per-show label / page sectioning — see inline comments there).
- **Duration** (`movie/duration.php`): clock icon + "N Min.", styled as a dark filled chip
  to stand apart from the outlined language badges. Always last in the row.

Order in both views: FSK → format flags/languages → duration.

### Back Link (`utilities/back-link.php`, `_back-link.js`)

"Zurück zur Übersicht" at the top of `.detail__inner`, on all three detail views (not on
generic articles). Progressive enhancement:

1. Renders as a real `<a href>` to the relevant overview (movies → `/programm`;
   vorschau/veranstaltung → their category route) — works without JS, handles direct access.
2. `_back-link.js` intercepts the click: if `document.referrer` is same-origin **and**
   browser history exists, it calls `history.back()` instead — restoring the visitor's exact
   scroll position on the list they came from.

### Flipped Titles (`.u-flipped-title`)

- Rotated 90° counterclockwise on desktop
- Positioned absolutely on the left side of content
- Uses `transform: rotate(270deg) translate(-100%, -100%)`
- Container needs `.u-flipped-title-container` for positioning context

### Truncation System (`.u-truncate`)

A reusable pattern for truncating long content with overflow detection.

**Structure:**

```html
<div class="u-truncate [card-specific-class]">
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p class="u-truncate__tagline">Optional tagline</p>
    <div class="u-truncate__content">
        <div class="description">Content...</div>
    </div>
    <a class="u-truncate__more">…</a>
</div>
```

**How it works:**

1. JavaScript measures poster image height (`getBoundingClientRect()`)
2. Calculates header area (title + tagline) via `offsetTop` of `.u-truncate__content`
3. Remaining space is rounded UP to nearest line-height (`Math.ceil`)
4. Sets `--truncate-height` CSS variable on the container
5. `.is-overflowing` class added when content exceeds height
6. "Read more" link (…) shown only when overflowing

**CSS Variables:**

- `--truncate-height`: Dynamic, set by JS based on poster height
- `--truncate-content-height`: Fallback default (`15rem`)

Height sync currently targets only `.listing-card` (see `CARD_SELECTORS` in `_truncate.js`) —
detail views don't use the poster-height-sync variant of this pattern.

### Gallery Lightbox (`_gallery.css` / `_gallery.js`)

Native `<dialog>`-based lightbox for `{gallery ...}` placeholders (`com_weltspiegel.gallery.default`
layout). Aesthetic details:

- Frosted backdrop: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` + translucent dark tint (falls back to a
  plain dark overlay where `backdrop-filter` is unsupported)
- Open/close fade via `@starting-style` + `transition ... allow-discrete` (works with the
  native `display` toggle of `<dialog>`)
- Each image change re-triggers a subtle fade/scale-in animation (JS forces a reflow)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Optional teaser image (`{gallery ...|teaser=random}` or `|teaser=filename.jpg}`): rendered
  large above the grid; its duplicate grid thumbnail is hidden (`.gallery__item--teaser`) but
  stays in the DOM so lightbox indexing/navigation still includes it
- Optional `|altnames` flag: use cleaned-up filenames as alt text instead of the default
  "Article title – Bild N" (image editors set filenames deliberately, e.g. with hyphens kept
  as-is — only underscores are turned into spaces)

### Image Popout (`_image-popout.css` / `_image-popout.js`)

Generic, gallery-independent modal for showing a larger version of any image. Trigger via
`[data-image-popout="path/to/large.jpg"]` on an anchor wrapping a smaller `<img>`. Progressive
enhancement: without JS, the `href` on the same anchor still navigates to the large image
directly. Shares the lightbox's frosted/fade aesthetic. Useful for e.g. a small map preview
that opens a full-size map image — no third-party map service required.

### Cookie Consent v2 (`mod_cookie_consent`, category based)

The template override (`html/mod_cookie_consent/default.php`) renders one switch per
consent category, fully data-driven from a module subform parameter (`categories`) — the
module itself knows nothing about specific features (e.g. YouTube). `_cookie-consent.js`
exposes `isConsentGranted(category)` as the single source of truth; consumers like
`_youtube.js` only read/react to their own category via the `cookieConsentChanged` event.
No auto-open on first visit (the site only sets a strictly-necessary session cookie without
consent) — the banner opens via the drawer, a feature placeholder click, or any
`[data-cookie-settings]` link (e.g. from the privacy policy).

### View Transitions

Enabled via `@view-transition { navigation: auto; }` for smooth page transitions.

### Naming Convention

- BEM-style naming: `.block__element--modifier`
- Shared components: `.listing-card__title`, `.detail__poster`, `.format-badge--duration`
- Utility classes prefixed with `u-`: `.u-truncate`, `.u-flipped-title`
- Showtimes grid keeps its historical `.showbox-*` naming (not renamed to avoid churn in
  `booking/showtimes.php` and `_showbox.js`)

### Build System

- Vite for bundling and minification
- Output: `template.min.css`, `template.min.js`
- Sourcemaps enabled for JS debugging

## JavaScript

### Entry Point

`media/js/template.js` imports:

- `_navigation.js` - Mobile menu toggle
- `_truncate.js` - Overflow detection and height sync
- `_showbox.js` - Showtimes viewport navigation (prev/next week)
- `_youtube.js` - Consent-aware YouTube embeds
- `_cookie-consent.js` - Consent manager + banner (category based)
- `_current-events.js` - Homepage current-events module
- `_gallery.js` - Gallery lightbox
- `_image-popout.js` - Generic image modal
- `_back-link.js` - Smart "back to overview" link (history vs. href fallback)

### Truncate Module Exports

```javascript
export { updateTruncateStates, isOverflowing, syncAllCardHeights };
```

### Event Listeners

- `DOMContentLoaded`: Initialize truncate, setup image load listeners
- `load`: Re-check truncate states after all images loaded
- `resize`: Debounced (100ms) re-calculation of heights

## Quick Reference

### Adding a New List or Detail View

Reuse the shared components instead of creating new CSS:

- List view: wrap items in `.listing` / `.listing-card`, use the `__meta`/`__details`/
  `__showtimes` slots only where you have data, render descriptions through the
  `utilities.truncate` layout with `'class' => 'listing-card__content'`.
- Detail view: wrap in `.detail` / `.detail__inner`, add `.detail__back` via
  `utilities.back-link`, use `.detail__poster` (float) + `.detail__body`.
- Only add a new CSS partial if the view needs something genuinely new — check
  `_listing.css` / `_detail.css` first.

### Changing Accent Color

Update `--color-accent` in `_variables.css`. Hover state auto-calculates via `color-mix()`.

### Adjusting Breakpoints

Main breakpoint is 768px. If changing:

1. Update media queries in CSS files
2. Update `DESKTOP_BREAKPOINT` constant in `_truncate.js`
